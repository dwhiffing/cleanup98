Starts with windows 98 startup
You have run out of disk space on C:\ Run disk cleanup?
Windows cannot locate disk cleanup

You have to manually free up disk space by exploring the C:\ Drive from windows explorer

This starts very slow at first due to windows rendering slowly and deleting files slowly
it is also difficult to find files that can be deleted due to permissions

You must spend a currency to increase the rendering speed and file deletion speed, as well as to gain access to blocked files
