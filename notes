Starts with windows 98 startup
You have run out of disk space on C:\ Run disk cleanup?
Windows cannot locate disk cleanup

You have to manually free up disk space by exploring the C:\ Drive from windows explorer

This starts very slow at first due to windows rendering slowly and deleting files slowly
it is also difficult to find files that can be deleted due to permissions

You must spend a currency to increase the rendering speed and file deletion speed, as well as to gain access to blocked files

upgrade ideas:
  show file size
  show folder size
  auto deleter
    max number of windows
    speed of deletion

  sort by file size
  manual delete speed
  max manual select count?
  permissions
    different folders have different permissions levels to allow deleting of files
    higher permissions folders have more/bigger files
  
  disable delete confirmation
